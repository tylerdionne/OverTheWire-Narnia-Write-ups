Looking at the C source file we can see that this program takes a command line argument and checks to see if one is provided or not  
if no command line argument is provided it prints the line "Usage: %s argument\n", argv[0]);‚Äù  
if there is a command line argument and then the program copies the argument to a character array named buf that is allocated 128 bytes and then prints the contents of buf.  
To pass a command line argument in C we simply have to run the program like so  
$ ./narnia2 hello  
When we do this we see the following output:
